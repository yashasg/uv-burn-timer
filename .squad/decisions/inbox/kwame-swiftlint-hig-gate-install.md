# Kwame decision inbox — SwiftLint HIG error gate install

## Decision

Install SwiftLint in two places:

1. Exact-pin `SimplyDanny/SwiftLintPlugins` `0.63.2` in `app/Package.swift` so SwiftPM/Xcode can attach lint as a build-tool-only dependency with no runtime binary linkage.
2. Install Homebrew `swiftlint` in CI and invoke it explicitly from both `.github/workflows/ci.yml` and `build.sh`, using `--strict` so any HIG rule that is accidentally left at warning still blocks the pipeline.

Seed the harness with the four agreed HIG rules plus two audit-backed layout rules (`hardcoded_frame_dimensions`, `literal_system_font_size`) so the current tree already exercises the error gate while Iris prepares the broader catalog.

## Context

The repo currently hardens the Swift compiler via `SWIFT_TREAT_WARNINGS_AS_ERRORS`, but HIG regressions can still sneak through as ordinary review debt. Apple’s HIG treats minimum 44×44pt hit targets, semantic colors that adapt to appearance/contrast, semantic text sizing, and sheets as focused single-task presentations as shipped UX contracts rather than optional polish.

Iris is landing the larger HIG rule catalog separately at `.squad/decisions/inbox/iris-hig-lint-rule-catalog.md`. The harness here needs to make that next merge mechanical instead of architectural.

## Trade-offs

- **`SwiftLintPlugins` vs `realm/SwiftLint` as the package dependency:** chose `SimplyDanny/SwiftLintPlugins` because its README documents the plugin-only package advantages: no full SwiftLint source checkout, no extra SwiftSyntax dependency graph, and no accidental runtime product linkage. Cost: CI still needs a CLI install for explicit script/workflow steps.
- **SPM plugin vs Homebrew-only install:** the plugin keeps package/Xcode integration Apple-native and build-tool-only; Homebrew gives deterministic CLI availability for `build.sh` and GitHub Actions. Using both is intentional defense in depth.
- **`--strict` vs plain lint:** `--strict` ensures a rule misconfigured as warning still fails CI. Cost: unrelated legacy SwiftLint debt would also block. To keep the gate focused, `.swiftlint.yml` disables the repo’s existing non-HIG SwiftLint debt and leaves the hard block centered on HIG rules.
- **Error vs warning severity:** raw RGB colors, literal live-content frames, literal `.font(.system(size:))`, nested `NavigationStack` inside `.sheet`, and sub-44pt gestures have direct dark-mode, Dynamic Type, or task-flow consequences. They should be treated like build-breaking correctness issues, not advisory warnings.

## Consequences

- `build.sh` now runs SwiftLint before any `xcodebuild` work and exposes `./build.sh lint` with the emoji reporter for local feedback.
- `.github/workflows/ci.yml` now installs SwiftLint via Homebrew and runs a dedicated strict lint step before `./build.sh`.
- `app/Package.swift` carries the exact plugin pin so future SwiftPM/Xcode invocations can keep using the same rule file without shipping SwiftLint in the app.
- Current baseline is intentionally red: the new harness surfaces **16 HIG violations** on today’s tree — `11` `hardcoded_frame_dimensions`, `4` `literal_system_font_size`, and `1` `navigation_stack_in_sheet`. Those fixes stay with issues `#95` and `#96`, not this wiring branch.

## Validation

- `swift package resolve --package-path app` resolved `SwiftLintPlugins` at `0.63.2`.
- `./build.sh` now fails fast on SwiftLint errors with Xcode-style file/line output when `swiftlint` is present.
- `./build.sh lint` emits fast local feedback and exits non-zero on the current HIG violations.
- With `swiftlint` intentionally absent from `PATH`, `RUN_TESTS=false ./build.sh` still completes successful Debug + Release builds.
- The post-change `xcodebuild test` path still exits non-green because of the repo’s existing two Swift Testing known-issue records in `ForecastPickerLogicTests`; this branch does not change app/test logic.
