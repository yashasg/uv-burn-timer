### 2026-05-22T03:32:09-07:00: User directive — HIG layout rules are ERROR day 1, no literal exceptions
**By:** yashasg (via Copilot)
**What:** Override Iris's "Error after grace period" severity bucket and her "allowed exception" carve-out for `minHeight: 44` / `minHeight: 56` HIG-touch-target floors. The new policy is:

1. **All HIG layout rules ship at `severity: error` on day 1.** No grace period, no "warn now, error in 2 weeks" ramp. The CI gate is the gate from the moment the SwiftLint PR merges.
2. **No literal numbers in layout — including HIG touch-target floors.** `.frame(minHeight: 44)`, `.frame(minHeight: 56)`, etc. must be backed by `@ScaledMetric` (e.g., `@ScaledMetric private var minTap: CGFloat = 44`). The raw literal does not satisfy the lint rule even though Iris originally exempted it.
3. **The `missing_min_touch_target` rule regex must enforce `@ScaledMetric`** as the backing, not a literal `44`/`56`/`88` count. Literals fail.
4. **Rationale (user-supplied):** Small screens (iPhone SE / mini) combined with AX5 Dynamic Type make a fixed-pixel 44pt tap target visibly cramped. `@ScaledMetric` lets the tap target grow proportionally with the user's text-size preference, which is what HIG actually intends. The literal is the easy interpretation of HIG; `@ScaledMetric` is the right one.

**Supersedes:**
- Iris's "Severity bucket recommendations" section in `iris-hig-lint-rule-catalog.md` — specifically the "Error after grace period (warn for now, error in 2 weeks)" bucket for touch-target and padding rules.
- Iris's "Allowed exception: Fixed minimum sizes that directly serve Apple HIG touch-target rules stay allowed (`minHeight: 44` / `56`)" carve-out documented in the same catalog.

**Action items dropped to Kwame this turn:**
- Apply error severity to ALL HIG layout rules in `.swiftlint.yml` on branch `squad/swiftlint-hig-error-gate`. No `severity: warning` on layout/padding/frame/touch-target rules.
- Tighten the `missing_min_touch_target` regex to require `@ScaledMetric`-backed minHeight; literal numbers like `minHeight: 44` are violations.
- Update the comment header in `.swiftlint.yml` to call out this policy explicitly so future contributors don't re-soften it.
- The 16 baseline violations + the literal `minHeight: 44`/`56` sites the audit didn't previously count are now ALL CI-blockers. Issues #95/#96 (Kwame HIG cleanup) become more urgent — they must land before this branch merges, OR this branch's CI will be red the moment it hits main.

**Note on Iris:** Iris's catalog isn't being rewritten retroactively (it's part of append-only decisions.md). She'll see this directive on her next spawn and update her skill (`.squad/skills/swiftlint-hig-ruleset/SKILL.md`) to reflect the new policy. The original catalog stays as the historical artifact; this directive is the authoritative supersession.
