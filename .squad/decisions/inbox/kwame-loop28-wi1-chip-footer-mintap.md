# Decision Drop — Kwame, Loop-28 WI-1: chip/footer `minTap` migration

**Date:** 2026-05-22T13:00:00Z
**Author:** Kwame (iOS Developer)
**Branch:** `squad/wi-loop28-1-chip-footer-mintap`
**Loop:** 28 / Work Item 1
**Status:** Local commit ready. Not yet pushed (Coordinator-gated).

## What

Migrated four pre-existing literal `minHeight: 44` call sites in
`app/Sources/UVBurnTimer/AppViews.swift` to the canonical
`@ScaledMetric`-backed `minTap` token, closing the residual HIG
Dynamic-Type-scaling debt Iris's Loop-26 post-merge audit identified.

Sites migrated:

| 2 | `RootView.spfChip` Menu label       |  330 | `.frame(maxWidth: .infinity, minHeight: 44)`            | `.frame(maxWidth: .infinity, minHeight: minTap)`               |
| 3 | `RootView.skinTypeChip` Button lbl  |  354 | `.frame(maxWidth: .infinity, minHeight: 44)`            | `.frame(maxWidth: .infinity, minHeight: minTap)`               |
| 4 | `PersistentFooter` Label            | 2153 | `.frame(minHeight: 44, alignment: .leading)`            | `.frame(minHeight: minTap, alignment: .leading)`               |

`RootView` already declared `@ScaledMetric private var minTap: CGFloat
= 44` (Loop-28 WI-0 / AV-19). `PersistentFooter` received a new
identical declaration with an explanatory `// MARK: - HIG
@ScaledMetric tokens` comment.

## Why

At default Dynamic Type these four sites render at the HIG 44-pt
floor. On iPhone SE at AX5 the literal `44` does NOT scale; the
`@ScaledMetric` form expands the floor proportionally to ~88 pt,
restoring reachability for users who depend on accessibility text
sizes. PR #98's `missing_min_touch_target` SwiftLint rule did not
flag these sites because its regex anchors on `\bButton\s*(` at the
call site and misses literals nested inside `} label: { ... }`
closures (Button / Menu / NavigationLink alike). The four sites
therefore passed the Loop-26 0-violations gate while still
representing real Dynamic-Type-scaling debt.

## Test-coverage change

### Added: Group LU (Loop-28 WI-1) in `MainScreenCleanupContractTests.swift`

- **LU1** — `RootView.locationChip` body uses `.frame(maxWidth: .infinity, minHeight: minTap)`.
- **LU2** — `RootView.spfChip` body uses `.frame(maxWidth: .infinity, minHeight: minTap)`.
- **LU3** — `RootView.skinTypeChip` body uses `.frame(maxWidth: .infinity, minHeight: minTap)`.
- **LU4** — `struct PersistentFooter` declares `@ScaledMetric private var minTap: CGFloat = 44` AND
  applies `.frame(minHeight: minTap, alignment: .leading)`.
- **LU5** — File-wide: `minHeight:\s*44\b` regex must find zero matches in `AppViews.swift`. This is
  the broad-scope safety net for any future regression at any literal site.

LU1–LU4 use struct-scoped substring slices (struct opener → next
`\nstruct `, or chip-name → next `private var `) to anchor each
contract to its declaring scope, mirroring the LT1 pattern from
Loop-28 WI-0 (Iris's recommended primitive for source-text guards).

### Removed: narrowed Loop-26 R2

`test_R2_appViewsDisclaimerCTAUsesMinTap` was a per-CTA guard that
only forbade the literal `minHeight: 44` on the DisclaimerCover "I
understand" CTA. LU5 (file-wide) subsumes R2's intent without leaving
a per-CTA guard whose name no longer describes its job. An inline
`// R2 — REMOVED in Loop-28 WI-1` comment block in the same file
preserves the audit trail.

### Updated: `test_EJ4_persistentFooterMeetsHIG44ptHitTarget`

Previously asserted `body.contains(".frame(minHeight: 44")`. Now
asserts both the struct-scoped `@ScaledMetric private var minTap:
CGFloat = 44` declaration and `.frame(minHeight: minTap`. EJ4
remains the dedicated Plunder C3-floor guard for the
`PersistentFooter` reach-back; LU4 is the new general struct-shape
guard.

### Updated: `ADR-0001` line citations

`PersistentFooter`'s `AboutView` push citation moved from line
**2133** → line **2144** (+11 lines from the new `@ScaledMetric`
block + MARK comment). Refreshed two citations in the ADR
(References § bullet at line 243, worked-example block at lines
296–298) and appended a `**Loop-28 WI-1 — line-number refresh
(chip/footer `minTap` migration):**` audit-trail paragraph to the
Loop-28 line-manifest section. Chip line numbers (301 / 320 / 339)
did not shift; only PersistentFooter and everything after it did.

## Verification

`./build.sh` GREEN end-to-end on Xcode 26.4 / iPhone 17 Pro / iOS
26.4:

- **Debug build:** clean (`SWIFT_TREAT_WARNINGS_AS_ERRORS=YES`,
  `-warnings-as-errors`).
- **Core unit tests:** 307 passed, 0 failed, 2 pre-existing known
  issues in `ForecastPickerLogicTests` (orthogonal, predate Loop-28).
  Group LU all green (LU1/LU2/LU3/LU4/LU5).
- **UI tests:** 9 passed, 0 failed (115.0 s total). The three
  Loop-28 WI-0 hittability tests
  (`testEstimateInfoButtonOpensAboutWithHighlightedApplicabilityAnchor`,
  `testEstimateInfoNavigationRoundTripReturnsToMainScreen`,
  `testSettingsSheetOpens`) still pass after the chip/footer
  migration — the visual layout doesn't change at default Dynamic
  Type (`@ScaledMetric` initial value is `44`).
- **Release build:** clean, signed, validated.

**SwiftLint strict:** 0 violations. No rule delta — the four
migrated sites passed SwiftLint baseline before too (which is
exactly why they survived PR #98). Confirms the
`missing_min_touch_target` label-closure blind spot identified by
Iris is real and remains scheduled for a swift-syntax AST
replacement (Loop-28+ follow-up #4 in `kwame/history.md`).

## SwiftLint heuristic blind spot (escape-route analysis)

PR #98's `missing_min_touch_target` regex (`.swiftlint.yml`):

```
included: ".*\\.swift"
name: missing_min_touch_target
regex: '\\bButton\\s*\\(.{0,200}?(?<!minHeight:\\s)(?<!minWidth:\\s)44'
```

The pattern anchors on `\bButton\s*(` at the call site. The four
migrated sites all live inside `} label: { ... .frame(...minHeight:
44) }` closures attached to Button / Menu / NavigationLink
constructors — the `.frame(...minHeight: 44)` literal is well past
the 200-char regex lookahead window, AND in two cases the host
constructor is Menu or NavigationLink, which `\bButton\s*(` never
matches in the first place. Both gaps must close before this rule
can be relied on as the sole touch-target floor enforcer. Until
then, LU5's file-wide source-text guard is the strict-mode safety
net.

## For Iris / Scribe

- Iris: confirms the Loop-26 post-merge audit "WI-1 chip/footer"
  item is now closed. The label-closure blind spot remains — please
  prioritise the swift-syntax AST replacement for
  `missing_min_touch_target` in Loop-29 or earlier.
- Scribe: merge this file into `.squad/decisions.md` under Loop-28
  closure. R2 deletion + LU1–LU5 addition + EJ4 update + ADR-0001
  line-citation refresh are the four discrete changes to record.
