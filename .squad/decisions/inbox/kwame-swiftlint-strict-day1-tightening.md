# Kwame decision inbox — SwiftLint strict day-1 HIG tightening

## Decision

Tighten the SwiftLint HIG gate so layout/touch/typography rules are hard errors from day 1 and `missing_min_touch_target` no longer accepts literal `minHeight: 44` / `56` as compliant. The rule now only treats nearby `.frame(...minWidth|minHeight: someIdentifier)` usage as a pass, which is the regex-level proxy for requiring `@ScaledMetric`-backed touch-target floors.

## Context

The user overruled Iris’s softer rollout policy and the literal `44` / `56` exception. The rationale is concrete: iPhone SE/mini widths combined with AX5 Dynamic Type make fixed 44pt touch targets feel cramped, while `@ScaledMetric` lets the hit area grow with the user’s preferred text size.

This branch is config-only. It should intentionally turn more existing UI debt red without attempting the cleanup itself; those fixes stay with issues `#95` and `#96`.

## Trade-offs

- **Regex heuristic vs real semantic validation:** SwiftLint custom regex rules cannot prove that an identifier is declared with `@ScaledMetric`. The chosen heuristic only distinguishes a bare identifier from a literal number near `Button` / `.onTapGesture`. Perfect enforcement would require AST-aware analysis.
- **Broader touch-target failures:** Buttons that rely on platform defaults or styling, rather than an explicit identifier-backed `minWidth` / `minHeight`, now fail this rule. That is intentional under the strict-day-1 policy; justified exceptions must use a per-line disable comment and PR rationale.
- **Hard-error rollout:** No grace period means CI will go red immediately on current debt. That is the point of this policy change, not an accidental side effect.

## Consequences

- `.swiftlint.yml` now states the hard-gate policy in its header and keeps the existing layout/touch/typography rules at `severity: error`.
- `missing_min_touch_target` now flags literal touch-target floors and bare `Button` / `.onTapGesture` sites without a nearby identifier-backed minimum frame.
- The strict lint baseline rises from `16` to **31 violations** on the current tree: `15` `missing_min_touch_target`, `11` `hardcoded_frame_dimensions`, `4` `literal_system_font_size`, and `1` `navigation_stack_in_sheet`.

## Validation

- `swiftlint --strict --config .swiftlint.yml` now fails with **31 violations** on the current tree.
- No app code was modified; this change is limited to lint policy + supporting squad documentation.
