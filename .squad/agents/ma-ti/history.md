## 2026-05-21T04:40:00Z — Main Screen Cleanup Contract Tests (Groups N–Q)

**8 new tests written** (Groups N–Q) for the main screen cleanup (WI #7 follow-on). Total test count: **122 passing** (5 known issues: I2, L1, O1, P2, Q1).

### Test groups delivered

- **Group N** (4 tests): `ProductCopy.aboutSunSafetyActions` contract. N1–N3 guard Plunder C2(i)/(ii) clauses at the constant level. N4 guards Plunder C1 via `disclaimerLinkLabel` (correct carrier — `aboutSunSafetyActions` carries C2 only, not C1).
- **Group O** (1 known issue): Photosensitization banner removal — manual-verification flag for K-1.
- **Group P** (2 tests): P1 reads AppViews.swift source at test time and asserts `aboutSunSafetyActions` is referenced (K-11 guard — passed because Kwame's K-11 was already on the branch). P2 is a known issue (AboutView in app target, unreachable from UVBurnTimerCoreTests).
- **Group Q** (1 known issue): Location reminder consolidation — manual-verification flag for K-8/K-9.

### Key patterns confirmed

**`withKnownIssue` still requires string literals** (not concatenated strings). Same lesson as WI-7 H–M — relearned on first compile attempt.

**`#filePath` source-level smoke tests work for cross-target contracts.** When a view lives in the app target (not testable from Core), reading the source file at test time is a viable contract guard. It's fragile against file renames but catches silent removal of K-11 wiring.

**P1 passed immediately** because Kwame's K-11 (`Text(ProductCopy.aboutSunSafetyActions)` in `notForMeAnchor` VStack) was already in the branch — the test correctly reflected live state.

## 2026-05-21T07:00:00Z — Pre-existing Test Failure Diagnosis and Fix (6 UI tests)

**Task:** Investigate and fix 6 UI test failures reported by Kwame-8 as "pre-existing" (not caused by his `LocationRationaleCard` removal).

### Root-cause diagnosis

All 6 failures were real regressions introduced silently during K-1/K-6/K-7 (commit `9402465`). They were missed because Kwame-7's build report ("all 114 tests pass") referenced the **unit test target only** (`UVBurnTimerCoreTests` — 114 tests), not the UI test target (`UVBurnTimerUITests` — 39 tests). The two targets ran under different schemes / build invocations and the UI test count was not checked. My Ma-Ti-2 session then added Groups N-Q to the **unit** target and reported "122 tests passing" without separately verifying the UI target — compounding the miss.

### Per-test disposition

| Test | Root cause | Disposition |
|---|---|---|
| `testScenario1ColdLaunchShows…` | K-6: `reapplicationFooter` removed from `PersistentFooter` | **A** — removed failing assertion |
| `testScenario8StaleEstimate…` | K-6: same | **A** — removed failing assertion |
| `testScenario5CappedEstimate…` | K-6: same | **A** — removed failing assertion |
| `testPhotosensitizationBannerRendersAsFullWidthBannerAboveHero` | K-1: banner permanently removed | **B** — deleted test |
| `testScenario4PhotosensitizationReachBackOpensAboutApplicability` | K-1: banner tap target gone | **A** — updated to `EstimateInfoButton` |
| `testAshaHeroVerdictCaveatLinkRendersAndDeepLinksToApplicabilityAnchor` | K-7: `HeroVerdictCaveatLink` removed | **A** — updated to `EstimateInfoButton` |

Also fixed: `acknowledgeDisclaimerAndChooseTypeIII` helper's settle signal (was waiting for banner hittability; updated to `EstimateInfoButton`).

**Result:** 38 UI tests, 0 failures. Unit suite unchanged at 122 (5 withKnownIssue). Combined clean.

## Learnings

### Verify your test counts before claiming "all passing" — the xcodebuild target split trap

When a project has both unit tests (`UVBurnTimerCoreTests`) and UI tests (`UVBurnTimerUITests`) under separate targets, `xcodebuild` with `-scheme UVBurnTimerCore` only runs the unit target. Running with `-scheme UVBurnTimer` runs **both** targets. Always confirm which scheme covers which targets before reporting "all passing." The 6 pre-existing failures in this session existed for at least two agent handoffs (Kwame-7 + Ma-Ti-2) without detection because both agents checked only the unit count.

**Reliable count command:** `xcodebuild -scheme UVBurnTimer … test | grep "Executed"` — verify line count matches `UVBurnTimerCoreTests` + `UVBurnTimerUITests` separately.

Three groups of tests in this suite (O1, P2, Q1) reduced to `withKnownIssue` wrappers because `AboutView`, `RootView`, and `UVIndexPlaceholderCard` live in the `UVBurnTimer` app target, which is not importable from `UVBurnTimerCoreTests`. The app target is a host-app binary, not a framework — it cannot be `@testable import`-ed without a host-app test bundle (XCTest's `TEST_HOST` pattern) or ViewInspector.

**Practical ceiling of the current test architecture:** Any behavioral contract that lives in a SwiftUI `View` struct body (layout decisions, Text content rendered from a conditional, toolbar button presence) is completely opaque to the SPM unit test target. Contract-level guards are limited to:
1. ProductCopy constant content (string assertions)
2. ViewModel/logic types extracted into UVBurnTimerCore
3. Source-file text matching (P1 pattern — brittle but better than nothing)

**What would fix this:** Extract display-critical decision points (e.g., "does the toolbar ⓘ button appear?") into a `@Observable` or value-type ViewModel in UVBurnTimerCore, testable as pure logic. This is the same recommendation as for `shouldShowRevealRow` in the WI-7 picker gaps.

## 2026-05-21T07:50:00Z — UI Test Axe: 38 → 5 Smoke Tests (Yashas directive)

**Directive:** "we have way too many ui tests, this app is a simulator resource hog" — cut to ~5 smoke tests.

**Cut rationale:** 38 UI tests on a single-screen app is over-indexed on the UI layer. The vast majority of the deleted tests duplicated coverage that already existed (or should exist) at the contract layer in `UVBurnTimerCoreTests`:
- 7 attribution visibility tests → `ProductCopy.weatherAttributionServiceName` is already a constant; no simulator needed
- Copy-string assertion tests → `ProductCopy` contract tests cover these in milliseconds
- Edge-case state tests (stale/capped/uncapped estimates) → ViewModel logic tests cover the invariants
- Per-surface presence tests (Location+SPF row geometry) → Contract tests on the chip-row logic

**The 5 smoke tests kept:**
1. `testAppLaunchesWithoutCrash` — cold start with seeded estimate, main screen renders ≤10 s
2. `testSkinTypePickerEndToEnd` — disclaimer → skin type picker → Type III → main screen
3. `testLocationButtonFiresLocationRequest` — "Use my location" starts location flow, not Settings
4. `testForecastPickerCardIsRendered` — structural: "UV Forecast" header scrollable on main screen
5. `testSettingsSheetOpens` — gear tap → Settings nav bar appears

**Result:** 38 tests → 5, 1188 lines → 177 lines, ~5–8 min simulator time → ~60 s. Unit suite unchanged at 122 tests (5 withKnownIssue).

### Test-pyramid lesson: contract tests > UI tests for single-screen apps

The correct pyramid for this app:
- **Base (fast, many):** Unit tests — pure functions, math, state machines
- **Middle (medium):** Contract tests (`UVBurnTimerCoreTests`) — ProductCopy constants, ViewModel logic, picker rules
- **Apex (slow, few):** UI smoke tests — cold launch, core flow, structural presence

The simulator is a finite resource. Every UI test that can be replaced by a contract test should be. On a single-screen app where 90%+ of behavioral contracts live in constants and ViewModels, the UI test suite should be a thin smoke layer, not a comprehensive regression suite.

## 2026-05-21 Ma-Ti-3 + Ma-Ti-4: Pre-existing Failures + UI Test Axe

Ma-Ti-3 diagnosed and fixed 6 pre-existing UI test failures (all Disposition A/B from K-1/K-6/K-7 removals). Ma-Ti-4 executed Yashas directive: UI test count reduced 38 → 5.

**Ma-Ti-3 outcome:** 38 tests, 0 failures. Root causes: K-1 removed PhotosensitizationBanner, K-6 removed reapplicationFooter, K-7 removed verdictCaveatLink. All 6 failures were intentional removals, not bugs.

**Ma-Ti-4 outcome:** 5 smoke tests kept (AppLaunches, SkinTypePickerE2E, LocationButtonRequest, ForecastPickerCard, SettingsSheetOpens). 33 tests deleted. Simulator time 5–8 min → 60 sec.

**Discipline note:** Future handoffs must verify BOTH unit target (UVBurnTimerCoreTests) + UI target (UVBurnTimerUITests), not unit-only.

**Test pyramid lesson:** Single-screen apps benefit from contract-test coverage > UI tests for individual surface assertions.
- 2026-05-19T22:50:27.684-07:00 (duration formatting tests): Aligned duration-format coverage with Kwame’s in-progress hours/minutes implementation. Core tests now cover under-1-hour minutes, exact 1 hour, over-1-hour burn estimates, the sunscreen 2-hour cap, and No UV unavailable display/accessibility. UI expectations now target compact hero strings such as `Up to 2 hr` and `~1 hr 20 min`. SwiftPM core tests pass (62/0); full Xcode build/test was attempted with project-local DerivedData but did not complete before timeout, so simulator UI validation remains blocked.

### 2026-05-21T00:55:49Z — Incoming test suite updates for UVI forecast feature (WI-7 round 2)

- **Drop tests (if written):** Any test asserting opacity/gray visual demotion on forecast rows D6–10 (flat treatment now locked).
- **Add test assertions (CRITICAL for compliance):**
  1. Card-level `.caption .secondary` footnote present on 10-day forecast card; text matches "UV accuracy beyond 3–5 days decreases as cloud cover becomes harder to predict."
  2. Picker refuses to compute burn-time for any date selection > D+7 (returns `.none` or refusal-state enum, not a number).
  3. Integer UVI rendered for day-indices 0–4 only; no integer UVI for day-indices ≥5 on 10-day card.
  4. WHO category band thresholds match locked WHO 2002 values exactly: 0–2 (Low), 3–5 (Moderate), 6–7 (High), 8–10 (Very High), 11+ (Extreme).
  5. Picker default date/time = current date/time (rounded to next full hour, or now if within first half of current hour).
  6. UVI 0 hour → "No UV at this hour — no sun protection needed" display (not ∞, not a number).
  7. No-skin-type gate on picker (same as live card): shows "Set your skin type to see a planned burn window" prompt.
  8. Forecast-unavailable hour → "Forecast unavailable for this time" with retry button; Done button disabled.
  9. Day 8–10 picker selection (if D+10 clamping used as fallback) → graceful-refusal message renders.
  10. L3 chevron ("Is this estimate for me?") present on forecast card footer; navigates to About @ photosensitizer enumeration section.
  11. Photosensitization re-disclosure text present on picker sheet (D-2026-05-19-013 wording carried).
  12. WeatherKit attribution present on forecast card and picker-sheet surfaces.
- **Edge-case coverage:** Sunrise/sunset computation (sun below horizon = UVI 0); ReduceMotion behavior (instant swap vs eased animation); picker range clamping at data boundary (if WeatherKit returns <10 days).
- **Orchestration log / session log:** Attached to `.squad/log/2026-05-21T00:55:49Z-uvi-forecast-pushback-round-2.md`.


## 2026-05-21 Session Update — WI-7 Consolidation Round

**Context:** WI-7 design is fully locked. Wheeler has ratified polar-region science. All blocked questions resolved. Only implementation remains.

**Status for Ma-Ti:** Test acceptance criteria are complete and reconfirmed. Wheeler's polar-region science ratification (2026-05-21T01:34:16Z) confirms no special test cases needed beyond the already-locked list. Specifically:

**Test plan stands (per Gi §8 + Iris §1 + Wheeler ratification):**
1. Hourly card scroll — verify smooth horizontal scroll, cell visibility
2. Day 1–5 vs 6–10 row rendering — numeric UVI present D1–D5 only, TierBadge on all 10
3. Picker date range clamping at D+7 — verify DatePicker boundaries + boundary hours
4. UVI-0 edge case — verify `BurnTimeEstimate` returns `.infinity` + `tier: .none`; UI shows `"No UV at this hour"`
5. No-skin-type gate — verify picker shows prompt, Done disabled until skin type set
6. Forecast-unavailable retry — verify error block appears, Done disabled, Retry button functional
7. VoiceOver per-row labels — verify accessibility labels on day/hour rows
8. Dynamic Type (accessibility3+) — verify hourly card adapts to `LazyVStack` at large sizes
9. Reduce Motion — verify picker date change swaps result instantly (no animated count-up)
10. L3 chevron → About anchor — verify "Is this estimate for me?" link opens correct anchor

**No additional polar-night test cases needed.** Wheeler confirmed:
- Burn-time formula at UVI=0 is already correct (returns `.infinity`, no special handling)
- Polar-day sustained 24h UVI does not change formula (single-session model still correct)
- No `.polarNight` enum case in `UVResult` (`.nighttime` covers all UVI=0 cases indistinguishably)
- UI-layer collapsed state (Iris's "No UV today — sun does not rise at this place") does not require special-case test phrasing

**One pending:** Wheeler's copy MODIFY ("latitude" → "this place"). Iris will update the spec; Ma-Ti to verify the phrasing in test cases matches the final Iris spec.

Acceptance criteria are locked. Ready for test implementation.

## 2026-05-21 — WI-7 Unit Test Suite (Groups A–G) — SHIPPED

**All 27 WI-7 tests written, committed, and passing.** Summary of learnings:

### Key type name corrections (charter vs. reality)
- Charter used `UVUnavailableReason` → Kwame has `UnavailableReason`
- Charter used `.unavailable(.snapshotExpired)` → actual labeled: `.unavailable(reason: .snapshotExpired)`
- Charter used `snapshot.dailyForecasts` / `snapshot.hourlyForecasts` → Kwame has `.days` / `.hours`
- Charter used `HourlyForecastEntry.date` → Kwame has `HourForecast.timestamp`
- `DayForecast` has no `solarNoon` field — polar-night is UVI=0 → `.nighttime` with no special storage

### Clock-injection gotcha
`ForecastStore.uvIndex(at:)` checks staleness via `Date()` (wall clock). `isStale(now:)` IS injectable but `uvIndex(at:)` doesn't use it. Workaround: use `expirationDate: Date.distantFuture` in every "fresh snapshot" helper.

### ForecastStore test isolation pattern
Use `internal init(fileURL:)` + UUID-named file under `cachesDirectory`. Clean up with `defer { try? FileManager.default.removeItem(at: url) }`. Do NOT use `/tmp` (forbidden by environment).

### C16 known issue — missing entry fallback
`ForecastStore.uvIndex(at:)` returns `.unavailable(reason: .snapshotExpired)` for missing hourly entries. Spec says `.nighttime`. Gap tracked in `.squad/decisions/inbox/ma-ti-missing-hour-coercion.md`. Test wrapped with `withKnownIssue(...)`.

### Mock/protocol pattern for WeatherKit
WeatherKit types are uninitializable in SPM unit tests. Solution: `ForecastProviding` protocol in Core + `StaticForecastProvider`/`FailingForecastProvider` test doubles. Full pattern documented in `.squad/skills/forecast-store-test-patterns/SKILL.md`.

### ForecastRefreshCoordinator injection
`handleSceneActive(currentLatitude:currentLongitude:now:)` is fully injectable. Groups E/F/G tests work cleanly. The real `WeatherKitForecastProvider` doesn't yet conform to `ForecastProviding` — Kwame needs to add that wiring.

### Final outcome
- 97 tests total: 96 pass + 1 known issue (C16)
- 4 commits on `feature/wi-7-uv-forecast`
- Spec ambiguity: `.squad/decisions/inbox/ma-ti-missing-hour-coercion.md`
- Test pattern skill: `.squad/skills/forecast-store-test-patterns/SKILL.md`

## WI-7 Test Suite Complete — 2026-05-21T02:38:00Z

97 unit tests implemented and passing (Groups A–G). Full coverage of ForecastStore actor, WeatherKitForecastProvider, persistence, DST coercion, polar night handling, and edge cases. C16 ambiguity resolved by Kwame's b183dc9 fix.

## 2026-05-21T03:10:00Z — WI-7 ForecastPickerLogic tests (Groups H–M)

**17 new tests written** (Groups H–M) for `ForecastPickerLogic` pure functions. Total test count: **114 passing** (2 intentional known issues: I2, L1).

### Key patterns learned

**Epoch arithmetic beats UTC calendar extraction.** Using `Calendar(identifier:).dateComponents(...)` to verify UTC hours fails on machines with non-UTC local timezone (observed +4h offset). All hour/day assertions now use `Date(timeIntervalSince1970: epoch + n*3600)` comparisons — timezone-independent and clearer.

**Epoch constants need careful verification.** The comment `// 2026-05-23 12:00:00 UTC` on `baseEpoch = 1_748_016_000` in existing tests is wrong (actual: 2025-05-23T16:00Z). Always verify epoch values with arithmetic from a known anchor (2026-01-01 = 1767225600) rather than trusting comments.

**`withKnownIssue` accepts only string literals, not concatenated strings.** Swift Testing's `Comment` type is `ExpressibleByStringLiteral` — string concatenation (`"a" + "b"`) fails to compile. Use a single long string literal.

**Top-level computed `var` properties are not safe for Calendar.** `private var utcCalendar: Calendar { ... }` at file scope compiles but the timezone setting is not reliably respected when extracting components. Inline the calendar creation inside each function that needs it, or avoid UTC component extraction altogether.

### Testability gaps flagged (see .squad/decisions/inbox/ma-ti-picker-logic-gaps.md)

1. **`shouldShowRevealRow` not extracted** — The `forecastDays.count > 7` condition is inline in `ForecastPickerView.dayListSection`. L1 (default collapsed state) requires a SwiftUI test host. Recommend `ForecastPickerViewModel` struct.

2. **`sameHourOnDay` does not validate hour availability** — The pure function returns a UTC date without checking it exists in the target day's `[HourForecast]` array. Consumer (`selectDay`) clamps post-call, but this makes I2 (missing-slot edge case) untestable as a pure function.

3. **`burnCardDatePrefix` same/different-day branching** — The implementation correctly branches on `utcCal.isDate(selectedDate, inSameDayAs: now)`: same day → `"Burn time at [hour]"`, other day → `"Burn time on [weekday] at [hour]"`. Iris spec §5 is now accurately matched.
- **2026-05-21 WI-7 Sprint Complete**: ForecastPickerLogic test suite delivered (17 tests, Groups H–M). All 114 tests pass (97 baseline + 17 new). Three testability gaps identified (shouldShowRevealRow exposure, burnCardDatePrefix future-today variant, sameHourOnDay hour-availability validation)—all deferred to future sprint as low-urgency.

---

## 2026-05-21T04:15:00Z — WI-7 Final Validation

Kwame's final 2 commits (c772df1, 7bee563) shipped all 10 Iris §8 items with clean test results:
- **114 tests pass** on existing test infrastructure (no test regressions)
- **Build clean** — no compiler warnings or errors
- **TODO markers removed** — both Iris §8 items 9 + 10 complete

No new test gaps surfaced. All existing WI-7 coverage (Groups A–M) remains valid. Feature branch ready for user GitLab MR.

## 2026-05-22T02:58:03-07:00 — SwiftLint HIG gate installed

SwiftLint now hard-gates CI before tests (Kwame's branch `squad/swiftlint-hig-error-gate`), so test-only changes may trigger lint failures if they touch view files. 16 baseline HIG violations are now visible; Iris will HIG-pass them before merge.
Model assignment updated 2026-05-22T04:01: claude-opus-4.7 (premium Opus, always-on — overrides prior auto selection).

## 2026-05-22T04:05:00-07:00 — Loop-26 test audit (HIG #95/#96 + PR #98 + manual QA gates)

Audit written to `.squad/decisions/inbox/ma-ti-loop-26-test-audit.md`.

### Inventory snapshot
- **309 tests total** (300 unit `@Test` + 9 XCUITest `func test*`). Largest file: `BurnTimeCalculatorTests.swift` (218). MainScreenCleanupContractTests = 18 (Groups N–Q).

### Key findings
1. **Both manual checklists FAIL by loop.md §6** — sign-off blocks blank, non-automatability explicitly documented (contrast checklist §123–148, launch checklist §129–157). Build cycle is BLOCKED on TestFlight/App Store gates, NOT on daily merge work. Asset-token contract is partially satisfied via existing `Color("Severity*")` lookups + source-text guards (O1, T1).
2. **PR #98 SwiftLint regex has a hole:** numeric `.padding(N)` is NOT covered by any rule. #95 has 23 padding sites, #96 has 12 — all would pass lint silently if frames+fonts are fixed.
3. **`missing_min_touch_target` is a regex heuristic, not an AST check** — cannot prove backing identifier is `@ScaledMetric` (acknowledged in `.swiftlint.yml` itself).

### TDD recommendation
Write **Group R (8 tests)** in `MainScreenCleanupContractTests.swift` BEFORE Kwame's cleanup work — mirrors the `test_O1_*` source-text-guard pattern (`String(contentsOf: appViewsSwiftURL())` + identifier-boundary regex). R1–R6 pin literal frame/padding/font absence in both files; R7/R8 close the `@ScaledMetric` adjacency gap that SwiftLint cannot prove. Cost ~80 lines / 30 min. Carve-outs: `.padding(0)`, `.frame(...:0)`, `.frame(maxHeight: .infinity)`.

### Learning
- **The source-text guard idiom from O1 is the right primitive for HIG-token enforcement.** Compile-independent, fast, and audits the actual file Kwame edits — not just a built artifact. Avoids the SwiftLint binary-availability trap on local devs.
- **Sign-off blocks deserve a hands-off policy.** The contrast checklist's own truthfulness-contract clause (line 130) is the binding rule — auto-filling would violate D-2026-05-19-honest-privacy-copy. Always treat blank = FAIL = surface to loop maintainer, never paper over.

## 2026-05-22 — Loop-27 review

PR #98 (HIG cleanup + SwiftLint hard-gate) merged on main. Group R source-text guards in `MainScreenCleanupContractTests.swift` were extended to cover the three new `@ScaledMetric` tokens (R1 `minTap` adjacency in `HeroTimerCard`, `warningIconSize`, `numeralColWidth`) — closing the AST-equivalence gap that SwiftLint's `missing_min_touch_target` regex heuristic cannot prove. Full Debug build + unit + UI suite green locally and on CI pre-merge.

### Goal 5 verdict — FAIL (manual portion), GREEN (automated portion)

Re-read both physical-device checklists in full (`iris-contrast-qa-checklist.md` lines 1–161 and `iris-launch-readiness-checklist.md` lines 1–194). Both files are **intact and unaltered** since the Loop-26 audit — identical `Automation status (WI-21)` sections, identical `D-2026-05-19-honest-privacy-copy` binding clauses, identical blank sign-off blocks (contrast §113–121 / 7 fields; launch §117–127 / 8 fields). Per `loop.md` §6, blank = FAIL.

No agentic loop, CI runner, or simulator can honestly complete either sign-off — the acceptance criteria explicitly require a physical OLED iPhone (13 Pro + one of 15/16/17 Pro), a verified-linear polarized filter, a WCAG contrast tool (Xcode Accessibility Inspector or `colour-contrast-analyser`), and outdoor midday sun OR ≥ 50,000 lux bench light. The next build cycle owner with that physical kit is the one who unblocks Goal 5's manual axis; daily merge work is NOT blocked, but TestFlight + App Store promotion ARE.

### Artifacts written

1. `.squad/decisions/inbox/ma-ti-loop-27-checklist-automation-status.md` — formal Loop-27 verdict + two suggested (non-blocking, hands-off) WI-21 stanza patches for Iris to accept/reject. Neither patch touches the sign-off blocks themselves.
2. `.squad/decisions/inbox/ma-ti-loop-27-test-gaps.md` — three Loop-28 candidate WIs carried forward from Loop-26 (WI-28-A `literal_numeric_padding` SwiftLint rule, WI-28-B AST-level `@ScaledMetric` backing check, WI-28-C `./build.sh` SwiftLint-missing warning). No NEW regressions from PR #98.

### Learning

- **The "extend Group R when @ScaledMetric tokens land" pattern is now established.** Each new ScaledMetric introduced into `AppViews.swift` (or any view file) should be paired with a source-text guard in `MainScreenCleanupContractTests.swift` in the same PR. This keeps the AST-equivalence layer ahead of SwiftLint's regex heuristic and prevents silent drift when the lint window tunes change.
- **Hands-off discipline survives a second loop.** Loop-26 recommended it; Loop-27 applied it again with zero deviation. The two suggested patches in the inbox are purely informational stanza extensions — they extend the WI-21 narrative but never the sign-off block. This is the right tempo: surface staleness, but let the human-in-the-loop with the physical kit own the signature.

## 2026-05-22: Loop-26 closure — PR #98 merged (a8b1ac8)

SwiftLint HIG hard-gate wired and live on main. All 31 violations resolved (FPV 13 + AV 18). Issues #95/#96 closed. Post-merge audit PASS-WITH-NOTES (5 structural rule-coverage gaps deferred to Loop-28+). Privacy Policy hosting and physical-device sign-offs remain user-owned blockers.

**Commits:** 66cc6c9 (TDD), a643523 (FPV), 174be71 (AV) → merged as a8b1ac8
